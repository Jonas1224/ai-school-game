# AI Chatbot Configuration
# Add one or both API keys below. The system will try OpenAI first, then Gemini as fallback.

# OpenAI API Key (recommended)
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Google Gemini API Key (fallback)
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Note: You only need one of these keys for the chatbot to work.
# Copy this file to .env.local and add your actual API key(s).
